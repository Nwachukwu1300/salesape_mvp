# SalesAPE MVP

Turns small businesses into working online businesses automatically. Give us your Instagram or website URL, get a live website with lead capture and booking in minutes.

## Purpose

SalesAPE transforms solo and micro business owners into fully operational online businesses without the need for complex setup. Target users are local service businesses who currently get customers through Instagram or word of mouth but lack proper online infrastructure.

## Core Concept

1. User provides a website URL or Instagram URL
2. Optionally describes their business in natural language
3. System automatically understands the business
4. Generates a live website with branding, lead capture, and booking
5. Business starts receiving and managing leads immediately

## What Gets Generated

- Live website with business name and branding
- Lead capture form
- Booking calendar
- Business email for lead notifications
- Simple dashboard for lead management

## User Flow

```
Landing → Input URL/Instagram → Answer questions → Preview website → Publish → Share link → Receive leads
```

Success signal: Working website + real leads within minutes.

## Long-term Vision

Voice or chat input builds and runs a business end-to-end with full automation.
